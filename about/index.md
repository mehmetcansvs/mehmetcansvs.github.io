# About


## Hey there!

I hope you have a good time reading my content. Let me quickly introduce myself. My name is Mehmet (nice to meet you too!). I do data stuff and occasionally try to instruct to silicon based processors to make business decisions for me. My tools of trade are Python and its data/ai ecosystem packages. But, I'm also very fond of C++ (who doesn't really?).

Anyway, the main topics of this blog are data stuff, ai/ml and quantitative finance. The content reflect my own interests and prejudices, based on my skills. The format of the blog is pretty informal, almost like chatting. I try to give refences to important points that I make but I'm not writing a research paper and certainly this is not an academic blog. So, you'll have to trust me most of the time. If I say something bullshit, please correct me!

Why I write this blog (thanks for the question btw)? I'm very well aware of the fact that not many people are going to read this blog and I'm OK with that. I don't think it is a vain effort though. Just trying to share my knowledge and opinions to people who would care. But there is more. I'm trying to learn how to write well and that's not going to happen if I don't write! Second, I'm trying to improve my English since it is not my native language. 

It requires incredible amount of effort and time to write a good blog post. If you like one, please share it with the others. That would make me very happy.

I don't think it is necessary but here is a little disclaimer: *This is my personal blog. All the things here, opinions and views are mine and they don't represent any other person, institution or organization that I may be associated. Unless explicitly stated, I'm not associated with any product, project or vendor mentioned here. Also, I don't engage in rendering professional services in this blog and any information shared here might be incomplete or wrong.*
