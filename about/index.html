  <h2 id="hey-there">Hey there!</h2>
<p>I hope you have a good time reading my content. Let me quickly introduce myself. My name is Mehmet (nice to meet you too!). I do data stuff and occasionally try to instruct to silicon based processors to make business decisions for me. My tools of trade are Python and its data/ai ecosystem packages. But, I&rsquo;m also very fond of C++ (who doesn&rsquo;t really?).</p>
<p>Anyway, the main topics of this blog are data stuff, ai/ml and quantitative finance. The content reflect my own interests and prejudices, based on my skills. The format of the blog is pretty informal, almost like chatting. I try to give refences to important points that I make but I&rsquo;m not writing a research paper and certainly this is not an academic blog. So, you&rsquo;ll have to trust me most of the time. If I say something bullshit, please correct me!</p>
<p>Why I write this blog (thanks for the question btw)? I&rsquo;m very well aware of the fact that not many people are going to read this blog and I&rsquo;m OK with that. I don&rsquo;t think it is a vain effort though. Just trying to share my knowledge and opinions to people who would care. But there is more. I&rsquo;m trying to learn how to write well and that&rsquo;s not going to happen if I don&rsquo;t write! Second, I&rsquo;m trying to improve my English since it is not my native language.</p>
<p>It requires incredible amount of effort and time to write a good blog post. If you like one, please share it with the others. That would make me very happy.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it is necessary but here is a little disclaimer: <em>This is my personal blog. All the things here, opinions and views are mine and they don&rsquo;t represent any other person, institution or organization that I may be associated. Unless explicitly stated, I&rsquo;m not associated with any product, project or vendor mentioned here. Also, I don&rsquo;t engage in rendering professional services in this blog and any information shared here might be incomplete or wrong.</em></p>
