      <description>Hey there! I hope you have a good time reading my content. Let me quickly introduce myself. My name is Mehmet (nice to meet you too!). I do data stuff and occasionally try to instruct to silicon based processors to make business decisions for me. My tools of trade is Python and its data/ai ecosystem packages. But, I&amp;rsquo;m also very fond of C++ (who doesn&amp;rsquo;t really?).
Anyway, the main topics of this blog are data stuff, ai/ml and quantitative finance.</description>
