      <description>HELLO WORLD Since about that time, war had been literally continuous, though strictly speaking it had not always been the same war. For several months during his childhood there had been confused street fighting in London itself, some of which he remembered vividly.

      <description>Hey there! I hope you have a good time reading my content. Let me quickly introduce myself. My name is Mehmet (nice to meet you too!). I do data stuff and occasionally try to instruct to silicon based processors to make business decisions for me. My tools of trade are Python and its data/ai ecosystem packages. But, I&amp;rsquo;m also very fond of C++ (who doesn&amp;rsquo;t really?).
Anyway, the main topics of this blog are data stuff, ai/ml and quantitative finance.</description>
