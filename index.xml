      <description>The e You probably have heard the saying that &amp;ldquo;there is no force in the universe more powerful than compound interest&amp;rdquo;. It was supposedly said by Albert Einstein. The saying could be an urban legend but it points out the importance of the concept called exponential growth. Einstein could have said &amp;ldquo;there is no force in the universe more powerful than exponential growth&amp;rdquo; and he would have made the same point but I think there is this slight difference between them which is &amp;ldquo;possibility&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Hey there! I hope you have a good time reading my content. Let me quickly introduce myself. My name is Mehmet (nice to meet you too!). I do data stuff and occasionally try to instruct to silicon based processors to make business decisions for me. My tools of trade are Python and its data/ai ecosystem packages. But, I&amp;rsquo;m also very fond of C++ (who doesn&amp;rsquo;t really?).
Anyway, the main topics of this blog are data stuff, ai/ml and quantitative finance.</description>
